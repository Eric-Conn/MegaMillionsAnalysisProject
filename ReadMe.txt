For this project we analyze the winning numbers data from the Mega Millions lottery game.
We compute probabilities and look at distributions and perform various computations.

The jupyter notebook Lottery_Notebook.ipynb contains our analysis.



Notes:

This is a personal project.

I have no affiliation with the New York Lottery or the Mega Millions lottery game.
